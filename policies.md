# TL;DR

If your exclusive focus is getting answers and solutions, please save both of us
some time and look elsewhere. From the outset, I will be challenging you to
incorporate new programming techniques, explain your reasoning, and recognize
bugs you've written with my supporting perspective.

# Principles

* The goal of tutoring is *learning*.

* This is contrasted with *production*, which is inevitably a related goal in
  the process of higher education.

* The act of production is both *evidence* of learning as well as the *process*
  through which learning happens.

# Responsibilities

* Many students seek tutoring when faced with production of specific
  deliverables (assignments/projects). I am happy to contribute to your learning
  process via discussion of assignment specifics at any level of detail
  required, including analysis of options for first or next steps to take in
  tackling coursework, but at no point is my job to manage production.

* I have no objection to contributing to your learning process that includes
  production of deliverables, but *all* work assigned to you by your curriculum
  is your work. While I understand that getting started producing deliverables
  in a subject outside your expertise can be nerve-wracking, my business is not
  in producing any artifacts, in whole or in part, that are required for your
  grade in any curriculum.

* I appreciate that the reason you've enrolled in a challenging class is because
  you want to develop new skills, and coursework is the vehicle for that
  learning, but your job is not to be a typist for my narration. If you find
  yourself asking me "what do I write next?" know that it is essentially always
  very much the wrong question to ask, for multiple good reasons.

# Terms

* **If you bring me your coursework with the goal of producing deliverables**,
  my responsibility is to identify the learning objectives of your curriculum,
  develop an image of your approach to the concepts, and enable you to find the
  most relevant information with the tools and resources at our disposal. 

* **If you choose to request my attendance for the production of your
  deliverables**, I will help you understand your deliverable requirements,
  demonstrate relevant language, library and tool features, and brainstorm
  implementation design ideas and pseudo-code.

* When learning a new programming language, especially your first, but even if
  you've come to me with a language diversity class in Haskell or Scheme, it may
  seem as if the only way to know the answer is to have already seen the answer.
  In some part this is basically true: programming is hugely dependent on
  pattern recognition, and pattern recognition requires initial and repeated
  exposure to concepts. Regardless, my discretion in providing a syntax example
  of any concept within the framework of production of curriculum-required
  artifacts is absolute; if you forsee yourself arguing that any part of our
  business obligates a demand for me to produce any specific expression, no
  matter how insignificant it seems to you, you'll likely be unsatisfied with
  the rate at which your production progresses with my Socratic-lite method.

* There is a difference between my showing you how to debug your project and
  debugging your project for you. Even if there is not much typing involved in
  any particular fix, you should not expect to sit on your hands while I
  develop my own understanding of your delivered work.
